#### Note for prospective students (MS/PhD/Interns)
I am looking for motivated students who are good in mathematics and programming and are interested in pursuing research (MSR/PhD) in the broad areas of verification, program synthesis, and security. If you are interested, drop me an email with your resume with the subject tag *[ResearchApplicant]*. Note that the admission in to the program will be through the regular admission process for MSR/PhD students (refer the [cse@iitd admissions page](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/index.php/2011-12-29-22-45-50/degree-programs) for details). For internships, the expected time commitment from students is *at least* six months.
