My research is primarily in the area of software engineering and formal methods. I am interested in ensuring the reliability of parallel software via static and dynamic program analyses, model checking, and PL solutions. I am also interested in employing HPC towards the creation of scalable verification technology. My recent research investigations
have been in the area of systems security, data privacy, and Blockchain.

Prior to joining the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Delhi, I worked as a post-doctoral researcher in the [Systems Verification group](http://www.cprover.org/) at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/).

I am associated with the [VerTeCS research group@IITD](http://vertecs.iitd.ac.in/) and also an associated faculty member in the [School for Public Policy](https://spp.iitd.ac.in/).
