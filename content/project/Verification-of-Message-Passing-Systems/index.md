Message passing is pervasive -- from inter processs communication in multicores to high performance computing, message passing plays a central role. In this project, we envison to create a  
framework to analyse message passing systems. In particular: 

- Create efficient dynamic symbolic encodings for VCs in message passing programs

- Exploit the symmetry and parametricity to scale up the verification problem.
